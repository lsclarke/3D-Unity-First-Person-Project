The 3D Interaction Project is a Unity project I made in 3 week hopes of not only teaching myself how to recreate real world interactions within Unity but also a way to help show others as well. This project is a way to give others like me a chance to understand the the more advanced concepts behind C# programming within Unity. Each script is detailed with notes describing the backend of the code I made for this project. My goal is that even someone with basic Unity experience can see this project and learn from it.
